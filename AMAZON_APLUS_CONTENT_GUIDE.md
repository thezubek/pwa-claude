## Design Best Practices {#design-best-practices}

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Above the Fold** (First 2 modules)
   - Most compelling value proposition
   - Hero image with lifestyle context
   - Primary differentiator vs competitors

2. **Middle Section** (Modules 3-5)
   - Detailed feature breakdown
   - Technical specifications
   - Use cases and scenarios
   - Comparison charts

3. **Bottom Section** (Last 2-3 modules)
   - Package contents
   - Brand story/trust builders
   - Warranties, certifications, support

### Color Psychology by Category

#### GEAR (Electronics)
- **Primary Colors**: Blue (trust, technology), Black (premium, sophisticated), Silver/White (clean, modern)
- **Accent Colors**: Green (eco-friendly), Orange (innovation, energy)
- **Avoid**: Overly bright colors, busy patterns

#### WEAR (Fashion/Sportswear)
- **Primary Colors**: Aligned with brand palette, seasonal trends
- **Accent Colors**: Complementary to product colors
- **Lifestyle**: Natural settings, authentic moments
- **Avoid**: Over-saturation, inconsistent lighting

### Typography Guidelines

- **Headlines**: Bold, sans-serif, 36-48pt equivalent
- **Body Text**: Clean, readable, 14-18pt equivalent
- **Emphasis**: Use sparingly, italics or bold only
- **Alignment**: Left-aligned for readability, centered for impact
- **Contrast**: High contrast for text over images (use overlays)

### Layout Principles

1. **White Space**: Don't overcrowd; let content breathe
2. **Grid System**: Align elements consistently
3. **Visual Flow**: Left-to-right, top-to-bottom (Western markets)
4. **F-Pattern**: Most important info at top-left
5. **Mobile-First**: 60%+ of Amazon traffic is mobile

## Content Writing Guidelines {#content-guidelines}

### The 4 C's of A+ Content

1. **Clear**: Simple language, avoid jargon
2. **Concise**: Respect character limits, be punchy
3. **Compelling**: Benefits over features, emotional connection
4. **Credible**: Factual claims, social proof, certifications

### Writing Formula: FAB

**Features → Advantages → Benefits**

❌ **Wrong**: "Premium noise cancellation technology"
✅ **Right**: "Premium noise cancellation blocks 99% of ambient sound so you stay immersed in your music, whether on a noisy commute or focused work session"

### Headline Best Practices

- **Power Words**: Premium, Professional, Advanced, Ultimate, Essential
- **Numbers**: "3-Axis Gimbal" > "Multi-axis stabilization"
- **Questions**: "Ready for Professional Photography?" (sparingly)
- **Action**: "Experience Studio-Quality Sound"

### Body Copy Guidelines

**For GEAR Products:**
- Lead with performance metrics and specs
- Use technical language appropriately (assume moderate knowledge)
- Compare to benchmarks (e.g., "2x battery life of standard models")
- Address concerns (durability, compatibility, support)

**For WEAR Products:**
- Lead with feel and experience
- Use sensory language (soft, breathable, lightweight)
- Emphasize versatility and style
- Include care instructions subtly

### Tone of Voice

**Heventon.de Brand Voice**: Premium, Knowledgeable, Approachable

- **Do**: "Engineered for performance, designed for comfort"
- **Don't**: "AMAZING DEAL!!! BUY NOW!!!"
- **Do**: "Studio-grade audio meets all-day comfort"
- **Don't**: "The best headphones ever made in the universe"

### Character Limit Strategy

When approaching character limits:
1. Remove filler words (very, really, just)
2. Use em-dashes instead of commas for brevity
3. Abbreviate where standard (5.1GHz → 5.1G)
4. Break into bullet points if possible

### Localization for Amazon.de (German Market)

**Language Considerations:**
- Translate all text to German (not just machine translation)
- Adapt idioms and cultural references
- Use metric measurements (cm, kg, not inches/pounds)
- Comply with German advertising law (more strict than US)

**Visual Considerations:**
- Feature European models and settings
- Show products in context of European lifestyle
- Include CE marking where applicable
- Reference EU regulations (GDPR, RoHS) in trust badges

**German Copy Tips:**
- More formal tone than English (Sie vs. Du - use Sie for premium)
- Emphasis on quality and engineering ("Hochwertige Verarbeitung")
- Include technical details (Germans appreciate precision)
- Highlight "Made in..." if product origin is a selling point
